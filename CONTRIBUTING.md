<!-- /MarkdownTOC -->

## Assumptions

1. **You're familiar with [GitHub](https://github.com) and the [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) (PR) workflow.**
2. **You've read the Meilisearch [documentation](https://docs.meilisearch.com) and the [README](/README.md).**
3. **You know about the [Meilisearch community](https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/what_is_meilisearch/contact.html). Please use this for help.**

## How to Contribute

1. Make sure that the contribution you want to make is explained or detailed in a GitHub issue! Find an [existing issue](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/) or [open a new one](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/issues/new).
2. Once done, [fork the firestore-meilisearch repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) in your own GitHub account. Ask a maintainer if you want your issue to be checked before making a PR.
3. [Create a new Git branch](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository).
4. Review the [Development Workflow](#development-workflow) section that describes the steps to maintain the repository.
5. Make the changes on your branch.
6. [Submit the branch as a PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) pointing to the `main` branch of the main meilisearch-js repository. A maintainer should comment and/or review your Pull Request within a few days. Although depending on the circumstances, it may take longer.<br>
 We do not enforce a naming convention for the PRs, but **please use something descriptive of your changes**, having in mind that the title of your PR will be automatically added to the next [release changelog](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).
7. You will need to build the project with `yarn build` before pushing files.
8. Don't forget to add `js` files from the `./lib/` directory to your PR.

## Development Workflow

### Requirements <!-- omit in toc -->

To run this project, you will need:

- Node >= 15 && node <= 18
- Npm >= v7
- A google account
- Version `v10.9.2` of `firebase-tools` the Firebase CLI (latest does not provide the emulator):
  ``` bash
  yarn global add firebase-tools@10.9.2
  ```
  Add the directory for the commands of the packages installed globally in yarn, to access of firebase binary:
  ``` bash
  export PATH="$(yarn global bin):$PATH"
  ```

### Setup <!-- omit in toc -->

Sign in with your Google Account:
``` bash
firebase login
```
Enable the extension developer commands:
``` bash
firebase --open-sesame extdev
```
Install dependencies:
``` bash
yarn install:functions
```
Build the project:
``` bash
yarn build
```
Launch Meilisearch instance:
``` bash
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch
```
You may need to [install Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html) to run the emulator.</br>
Set emulator:
```bash
firebase init emulators
```
Launch emulator:
``` bash
firebase ext:dev:emulators:start --test-params=test-params-example.env --import=dataset --project=name-of-the-project
```
or just
``` bash
yarn emulator
```
The emulator runs with environment parameters found in `test-params-example.env` and with a provided dataset found in `/dataset`.

Once it is running, open the emulator in a browser at the following address: http://localhost:4000

NB: If you want to change your Meilisearch credentials or the plugins options you need to edit the `test-params-example.env` file.

### Tests and Linter <!-- omit in toc -->

Each PR should pass the tests and the linter to be accepted.

```bash
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch

# Tests
yarn test

# Tests in watch mode
yarn test:watch

# Linter
yarn lint

# Linter with fixing
yarn lint:fix

# Build the project
yarn build
```

### Run the backfilled-data script

- Set up credentials. The import script uses the application's default credentials to communicate with Firebase. Please follow the instructions [generate a private key file for your service account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#initialize-sdk).

- Run the import script interactively and run ONE of the following commands:
  - Run interactively:
    ```bash
    yarn run-cli
    ```

  - Or run non-interactively with paramaters:
    ```bash
    yarn run-cli \
      --project <project_id> \
      --source-collection-path <collection_name> \
      --index <index_uid> \
      --batch-size <100/default=300> \
      --host <host_address> \
      --api-key <api_key> \
      --non-interactive
    ```
    **Note**: The `--batch-size` and `--query-collection-group` arguments are optional. To see its usage, run the above command with `--help`.

- Run the project for development:
Launch Meilisearch instance:
``` bash
curl -L https://install.meilisearch.com | sh # download Meilisearch
./meilisearch --master-key=masterKey --no-analytics # run Meilisearch
```
Launch the watcher on the project:
``` bash
yarn watch
```
Launch the watcher on the script. You have to modify the informations of the playground script by your own parameters inside the `package.json` file:
``` bash
yarn playground
```

### Generate the README

The Firebase CLI offers the possibility of automatically generating the `README.md` file with the following command:
```bash
firebase ext:info ./path/to/extension --markdown > README.md
```
**Note:** Be careful this will only regenerate the text of the central part of the `README.md` from the Title: `Search in your Firestore content with Meilisearch` to the `**Cloud Functions:**` section.

## Git Guidelines

### Git Branches <!-- omit in toc -->

All changes must be made in a branch and submitted as PR.
We do not enforce any branch naming style, but please use something descriptive of your changes.

### Git Commits <!-- omit in toc -->

As minimal requirements, your commit message should:
- be capitalized
- not finish by a dot or any other punctuation character (!,?)
- start with a verb so that we can read your commit message this way: "This commit will ...", where "..." is the commit message.
  e.g.: "Fix the home page button" or "Add more tests for create_index method"

We don't follow any other convention, but if you want to use one, we recommend [this one](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### GitHub Pull Requests <!-- omit in toc -->

Some notes on GitHub PRs:

- [Convert your PR as a draft](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if your changes are a work in progress: no one will review it until you pass your PR as ready for review.<br>
  The draft PR can be very useful if you want to show that you are working on something and make your work visible.
- The branch related to the PR must be **up-to-date with `main`** before merging. Fortunately, this project [integrates a bot](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/bors.md) to automatically enforce this requirement without the PR author having to do it manually.
- All PRs must be reviewed and approved by at least one maintainer.
- The PR title should be accurate and descriptive of the changes. The title of the PR will be indeed automatically added to the next [release changelogs](https://github.com/meilisearch/meilisearch-js/releases/).

## Release Process (for internal team only)

Meilisearch tools follow the [Semantic Versioning Convention](https://semver.org/).

_[Read more about this](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/release-drafter.md)._

### How to Publish the Release <!-- omit in toc -->

⚠️ Before doing anything, make sure you got through the guide about [Releasing an Integration](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md).

Make a PR modifying the files with the right version.

Either by running `version.sh` with the new version. Example: `sh script/version.sh 0.3.1` or by updating manually the following files:

- [`package.json`](/package.json).
- [`package.json`](/functions/package.json) in the functions directory.
- [`extension.yaml`](/extension.yaml).
- [`version.ts`](/functions/src/version.ts).

Update the `CHANGELOG.md` file by creating a new section at the bottom `## Version X.X.X`. You can take inspiration from the [release draft](https://github.com/meilisearch/firestore-meilisearch/releases).

5. Once the changes are merged on `main`, you can publish the current draft release via the [GitHub interface](https://github.com/meilisearch/firestore-meilisearch/releases): on this page, click on `Edit` (related to the draft release) > update the description (be sure you apply [this recommandation](https://github.com/meilisearch/integration-guides/blob/main/resources/integration-release.md#writting-the-release-description)) > when you are ready, click on `Publish release`.

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the package to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firestore-meilisearch) and to [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions).

6. Test the newly released package on npm by launching it with `npx`:
```
npx firestore-meilisearch
```

7. Publish the extension by running the following command in the root of the extension directory:
```bash
firebase ext:dev:publish meilisearch/firestore-meilisearch
```
**Note**: `meilisearch` is the `publisher id` for this extension.

#### Release a `beta` Version

Here are the steps to release a beta version of this package:

- Create a new branch containing the "beta" changes with the following format `xxx-beta` where `xxx` explains the context.

  For example:
    - When implementing a beta feature, create a branch `my-feature-beta` where you implement the feature.
      ```bash
        git checkout -b my-feature-beta
      ```
    - During the Meilisearch pre-release, create a branch originating from `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*` named `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*-beta`. <br>
    `v*.*.*` is the next version of the package, NOT the version of Meilisearch!

      ```bash
      git checkout bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*
      git pull origin bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*
      git checkout -b bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*-beta
      ```

- Change the version in the relevant files (see how to publish the release section above) and commit it to the `beta` branch.

- Go to the [GitHub interface for releasing](https://github.com/meilisearch/firestore-meilisearch/releases): on this page, click on `Draft a new release`.

- Create a GitHub pre-release:
  - Fill the description with the detailed changelogs
  - Fill the title with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
  - Fill the tag with `vX.X.X-beta.0`
  - ⚠️ Select the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch and NOT `main`
  - ⚠️ Click on the "This is a pre-release" checkbox
  - Click on "Publish release"

GitHub Actions will be triggered and push the beta version to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firestore-meilisearch).

💡 If you need to release a new beta for the same version (i.e. `vX.X.X-beta.1`):
- merge the change into `bump-meilisearch-v*.*.*`
- rebase the `vX.X.X-beta.0` branch
- change the version name in the relevant files (see how to publish the release section above)
- creata a pre-release via the GitHub interface
